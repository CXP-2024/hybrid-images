# hybrid-images
This is a lab for hybrid images using a high-pass and low-pass filter
## Principles
The idea of hybrid images is to combine two images, one with a high-pass filter and the other with a low-pass filter. The result is an image that looks like one of the images when viewed from a distance and the other image when viewed up close. This is because the high-pass filter removes the low-frequency information and the low-pass filter removes the high-frequency information. When the two images are combined, the low-frequency information dominates when viewed from a distance, and the high-frequency information dominates when viewed up close.
